                        <p>Hi! I'm Dorothy and I'm a driven and passionate full-stack engineer. I love to learn and create new things. Though I'm a Computer Science major, design has always been a focus of mine. I believe that everything is driven by design and when paired correctly, technology and design can create a seamless and unforgetable user experience. Being a front-end developer in this world is all about putting design before development. Great design brings high quality. Great design isnâ€™t only about making things look luxurious or fancy. Design is all about understanding and solving problems. It is a function of the elegance of our solutions.</p>

                        <p>I am an explorer and adventurer first. The curious and thrill-seeking person I am translates in and out of work. These past couple years I've been on many new adventures that has only increased my love and appreciation for this beautiful world. From a week exploring Utah's Mighty Five to driving from Virginia to California's coast with two of my closest friends. From backpacking to hiking to kayaking -- this world is incredible and I firmly believe that the best times happen outdoors. I use photographs and videos to share my adventures and encourage people to take risks and get outside!<br><br>

                        <p>Living a healthy and fit lifestyle is another key part of my life. Staying active and eating well is part of me trying to feel the best I can. I grew up playing sports and that love has only grown as I've grown. From lifting to climbing, I love to be strong and push the limits of the human body. Pushing my body is a great way to relieve nervous energy and stress. It has taught me patience and hard work. I am constantly inspired by other athletes -- from gymnasts to American Ninja Warriors to rock climbers and they inspire me constantly. It's not only about fitness though, health and nutrition is equally as important. I actively promote a plant-based diet as what is best for the body but also the environment.Train hard and <a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com/everyone-eat-plants/" target="_blank">eat more plants</a>.</p>
