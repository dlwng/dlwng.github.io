                        <p>Hi! I'm Dorothy and I'm a driven and passionate full-stack engineer. I love to learn and create new things. Though I'm a Computer Science major, design has always been a focus of mine. I believe that everything is driven by design and when paired correctly, technology and design can create a seamless and unforgettable user experience. It's not necessarily the programming that I'm passionate about, but rather the culture of constantly innovating and creating.</p>

                        <p>I am an explorer and adventurer first. The curious and thrill seeking person I am translates in and out of my work. These past couple years I've been on many new adventures that has only increased my love and appreciation for this world. From a week exploring Utah's Mighty Five to driving from Virginia to California's coast with two of my closest friends. From backpacking to hiking to kayaking -- this world is incredible and I firmly believe that the best times happen outdoors. I use photographs and videos to share my adventures and encourage people to take risks and get outside!<br><br>

                        <p>Living a healthy and active lifestyle is another key part of my life. Staying active and eating well is part of me trying to feel the best I can. I grew up playing sports and that love has only grown as I've grown. From lifting to climbing to playing sports, pushing my body is a great way to relieve nervous energy and stress. It has taught me patience and hard work. I am constantly inspired by other athletes -- from gymnasts to American Ninja Warriors to football players.</p>

                        <p>This summer, I interned with Commonwealth Joe Coffee Roasters in Arlington, VA to redesign their entire site to match their brand and focus on providing Nitro Cold Brew Coffee to offices in the DC metro area in 6 weeks. I also worked to improve the user flow of the website.</p>
                        <p>I designed and coded a fully responsive custom theme for them that included 11+ page redesigns by myself. I helped to increase page views by 48%, users by 113%, and sessions by 111% over the course of my 6 weeks. The attached slider shows a before and after shot of the "About" page. I was able to play around with JavaScript and JQuery a lot to create some cool animations and carousel effects. This site challenged me to not only create harder elements, such as the timeline and changing contact forms on the About page but also to make them all responsive for mobile design. Due to the scale and time crunch of this project, it also taught me time and project management.</p>

                        <p>I a very proud of my work with this site. I was able to improve my web dev skills immensely and learn so much! You can now view the site live <a href="https://commonwealthjoe.com">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>This was my first freelance full website design, development, and branding project. I was able to design the website and the logo for Carli. She was a looking for a unique site design that would be able to feature her photography sessions, writing, and a place for her clients to contact her. She gave me full control of color scheme, fonts, and design. It was my first time building a complete, responsive, custom Wordpress theme. I am proud of my work and can't wait to see the growth of her business, after this site launch.</p>

                  		<p>One of my favorite features about this site is the gallery grid I created on the homepage. A portion of it is show in this image. It's a gallery that showcases some of Carli's photographs, her services, and important links. I thought it would be a creative way to show a new site visitor everything all her services in an aesthetically pleasing way.</p>

                                <p>Don Norman said it best: "Beauty and brains, pleasure and usability - they should go hand in hand." A website is only as good as the usability and flow of it. If a button is too hard to find, a user will click away immediately because they are frustrated. Through my experience as a designer and developer, I have learned what is good UX/UI. I can help your website be more intuitive for your users, and thus improving traffic and SEO.</p>
